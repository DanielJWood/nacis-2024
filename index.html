    Very cool to be here because I used to come to GeoDC a long time ago. Anyone here work at Mapbox? I interned right when it switched over from devseed to mapbox.

  Slippy maps terrify me

    I used to do a lot of slippy maps in the early days of (free) mapbox.

  So maybe it's possible.
</div>
<div>
  All I need is 
</div>
<div>
  to understand how any of this works
</div>
<div>
  🌎 OpenMapTiles for building tiles<br>
  🌎 Maputnik for style editing<br>
  🌎 PMTiles for tile hosting<br>
  🌎 Maplibre-gl-js for client-side rendering<br>
</div>
<div>
  😵‍💫
</div>
<div>
  So I tried to dig in
</div>
<div>
  And I got far enough to make this flowchart
</div>
<div>
  <img  src="images/image9.png">
</div>
<div>This is defintiely wrong. But this is closer to correct...</div>
<div>
  <img  src="images/image10.png">
</div>
<div>
  But I still didn't have a map
</div>
<div>
  And the OpenMapTiles makefile kept erroring out on my new mac
  <notes>https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles</notes>
</div>
<div>
  But not my old mac (???)
</div>
<div>
  And I have PTSD from 3 days lost in Postgres errors in 2012
</div>
<div>
  But we had a dataset that we really wanted to map
</div>
<div>
  And we wanted the map to be slippy
</div>
<div>
  😓

  😧
</div>
<div>
  Guess what? 
</div>
<div>
  You can kinda skip the whole tile generation step

  <notes>It's kinda hard to find, and of course its a big ass download. beware. But it is the whole world, downloaded every monday</notes>

  From there, Brent filtered to the continental US. Go Brent. Ask Brent how. idk
  <notes>Kudos to my teammate Brent Jones, based out of St. Louis, who was able to make heads and tales of all this</notes>
</div>
<div>
  Next, we just put the pmtiles into an S3 bucket.
</div>
<div>
  Okay, $ talk:
  <notes>And check out how cheap it is, by comparison to other options</notes>

  <a href="https://docs.protomaps.com/deploy/cost/">

<div>
  Then using MapLibre GL JS, add the PMTiles protocol
</div>

  <notes>Again, thanks Brent for your spelunking</notes>

<div>
  Now the fun part
</div>
<div>
  Styling
</div>
<div>With Maplibre/Mapbox's style spec</div>
<div>
  🤢

  Maputnik is a great place to start
  <notes>
    just use the default, and then attach the wires on your end

    I don't think this exists, and that's why it lied to me.

  <notes>transparentize is a css function that exists in sass, but as far as I can tell, not in mapbox or maplibre</notes>

  But after styling OSM with maputnik

<div>
  And our data with help from 🤖
</div>
<div>
  You get a pretty, customizable, fast and CHEAP map
</div>
<div>
  (oh psst: quick aside, I didn't go into the data that we are layering in here...We pre processed it in QGIS and then converted to pmtiles with tippacanoe. And I'm not going to tell you what it contains because we haven't launched yet but it's going to be cool...stay tuned. 2 weeks)
